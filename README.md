# Luminati-Proxy-Helpers

Project is intended for internal use.

Essentially provides a Laravel Facade for converting local Luminati proxies from one protocol to the other by using a port number offset.
Useful if you manage a large amount of gIPs from Luminati where you need to get details for both the SOCKS and HTTP protocols for one
particular proxy.
